"Beyond Spatial Pyramids: Receptive Field Learning For Pooled Image Features"
by Yangqing Jia and Chang Huang
presented at the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning

In this experiment, we train a k-means dictionary of 1600 centroids on patches of the
CIFAR-100 dataset. We then extract features using the triangle code and the random
pooling procedure described in the paper. The authors obtained a test set accuracy
of 54.5 % using these features in an SVM.
